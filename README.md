# NAME OF THE PROJECT:- INCORRECT CARTOON CHARACTER

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

We all have  noticed how villains always seem to behave in the most illogical and nonsensical ways? I mean, they spend all this time plotting their evil schemes, but then they leave obvious clues for the hero to find. It's like they want to get caught! Maybe they just need a good therapist to help them work through their issues instead of trying to take over the world. Or maybe they just need a reality check - like, hello, your death ray is not going to work if you leave the on switch exposed!

In this project, we will create a list of nonsensical actions performed by villains.
